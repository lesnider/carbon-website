This technique makes it easy to\nvisualize complex data at a glance. When it comes to heat maps, the most common\ncolor ranges are expressed in either sequential and diverging color scales\naccording to the type of data represented.\n\n#### Sequential scales\n\nSequential scales use a blended progression, typically of a single color, from\nthe lowest contrast to the highest contrast values, representing lows to highs.\nIt’s best practice to use a sequential scale with values that are all positive\nor all negative. Sequential heat maps can leverage the full range of the palette\n(from 10–100) to maximize contrast. Please note that the 3:1 minimum contrast\nrequirement does not apply to heat maps.\n\n<ChartDemoGroup demoGroup={getDemoGroupByTitle('heatmap')} light={true} />\n\n<Caption>\n  When cells get extremely small, a white border can hinder the intended effect.\n</Caption>\n\n#### Heat map behaviors\n\nAxis ticks and legend can be used to leverage the chart potential giving the\nusers additional information and dedicated kinds of interaction.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={4} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Heat map hover detail](images/04a_adv_heatmap_detail_288.png)\n\n<Caption>Exploration of a domain axis hover behavior</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Divergent scales\n\nDiverging scales show color progression in two directions: dialing down the\ncontrast of the first hue from one end to a neutral color at the midpoint, then\nincreasing the contrast of the second hue to the other end of the scale. The\nneutral midpoint is often referred to as the \"inflection point\" (for example, a\n0 value midway between -100 and +100).\n\n[Divergent scales](/data-visualization/color-palettes#diverging-palettes)\nrequire three colors for their correspondent values (min, max, and inflection\npoint) and Carbon has provided two approved palettes for divergent\nvisualizations. Although the examples here use the \"discrete\" (stepped scale)\nprovided by the Carbon palette, divergent heat maps often leverage \"continuous\"\nvalues (gradients) to accommodate situations that require more than 10 values.\n\n#### Inflection points\n\nWhile min/max values can be automatically detected from data, inflection points\ncan vary depending on data type. We default to zero in order to accommodate the\nmost common cases and include a feature flag within the code to specify\nexceptions. The data for a divergent heat map does not need to be symmetrical on\neither side of the inflection point. For example, the data set could have a zero\nvalue between -20 and +100 as well.\n\n## Tree maps\n\nTree maps can work for visualizing a part-to-whole relationship among a large\nnumber of categories—as long as the data is hierarchical and exact comparisons\nbetween the categories is not a primary concern.\n\nWhen dealing with large amounts of data in a constrained space, tree structured\nnodelink diagrams (like the network diagram shown above), grow too complex to be\nuseful. Tree maps provide an attractive alternative by maintaining a\nhierarchical structure while displaying rectangular quantities for each category\nand subcategory via area size.\n\n<div>\n  <ChartDemoGroup demoGroup={getDemoGroupByTitle('treemap')} light={true} />\n</div>\n\n#### Divergent tree maps\n\nDivergent tree maps combine Carbon's divergent color palette with the\nhierarchical structure of a tree map. Each rectangle has an area proportional to\na specified dimension of the data, but the rectangles can also be colored\nindependently according to an additional indicator.\n\nAs with [heat maps](#heat-maps), the diverging palette shows color progression\nin either direction from an inflection point (for example, a 0 value midway\nbetween -10 and +10). In the example below, the inflection point is simply an\naverage. Tourism can be mapped by the number of visitors to a certain country,\nbut the visualization can also compare this data to a yearly average. For\ninstance, even though one country may have a lot of visitors compared to another\ncountry, tourism for that country may fall below its annual average.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={12} colMd={8} colSm={4} >\n\n![Basic tree map](images/new_adv_treemap_02_928.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Example of a divergent tree map adding color as a second variable to a basic\n  tree map structure\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={4} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Basic treemap tooltip detail](images/new_adv_treemap_a_288.png)\n\n<Caption>Detail of a tooltip on a basic treemap</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column  colLg={4} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Tooltip detail](images/new_adv_treemap_b_288.png)\n\n<Caption>Detail of a comparative tooltip on a divergent tree map</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Circle packs\n\nA circle pack is a hierarchical visualization of data. It’s equivalent to a\nTreemap or a Dendrogram—where each node of the tree is represented as a circle\nand sub-nodes are represented as circles within a parent. The size of each\ncircle can also be used to represent an additional arbitrary value, such as\npopulation or file size. Color may also be used to assign categories or to\nrepresent an additional variable. Although they’re not as space efficient,\nCircle Packs reveal hierarchical structure better than Treemaps.\n\nFor Circle Packs with more than two levels of hierarchy, zoom functionality\nallows users to explore the data without compromising the contrast accessibility\nof the chart. We advise against disabling the zoom functionality except in cases\nsuch as preview charts, cards that expand to full view with the chart, etc.\n\n<div>\n  <ChartDemoGroup demoGroup={getDemoGroupByTitle('circlepack')} light={true} />\n</div>\n\n## Geospatial charts\n\n### Geographic overlays\n\n#### Choropleth map\n\nA map that uses differences in shading, coloring, or the placing of symbols\nwithin predefined areas to indicate the average values of a property or quantity\nin those areas.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={12} colMd={8} colSm={4} >\n\n![Choropleth map](images/09_adv_geo_choropleth_928.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Proportional symbol map\n\nSymbols driven by data are overlayed in geographical regions.

Connection Maps can also be useful in revealing spatial patterns\nthrough the distribution of connections or by how concentrated connections are\non a map.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={12} colMd={8} colSm={4} >\n\n![Connecting lines on a spatial map](images/11_adv_geo_connections_928.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Geospatial distortions\n\n#### Density-equalizing cartograms\n\nDensity-equalizing cartograms are the most common type of cartogram. In this\nsituation the mapping variable takes the place of the land area or distance in\nthe map, causing the map to become distorted in proportion to the substitute\nvariable.\n\nCartograms are useful for visualizing populations through different lenses — for\ninstance, ethnicities, political parties, or religious affiliation. Carbon does\nnot have a coded component for cartograms but online generators like\n[go-cart.io](https://go-cart.io/) allow you to upload your own data sets and\ndownload an .svg file.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={6} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Equal area map](images/12a_adv_cartogram_448.png)\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column  colLg={6} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Cartogram of population](images/12b_adv_cartogram_448.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Dorling cartograms\n\nThe Dorling Cartogram is a technique for representing data for areas that avoids\ngeography in favor of (normally) a geometric shape that represents the unit\nareas.

These themes can be used as is, or in conjunction with Carbon-styled data\npoints.\n\nThese styles can be used as is, or as a backdrop for other geospatial data sets.\nFor more complex data sets that require the full breadth of the Carbon charts\npalette, we suggest using either the White or the Gray 100 style for the most\naccessible results.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={12} colMd={8} colSm={4} >\n\n![Mapbox white style](images/15_adv_geo_mapbox_a_928.jpg)\n\n<Caption>Example of a Carbon’s White theme style in Mapbox</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={4} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Mapbox g10 style](images/16_adv_geo_mapbox_b_288.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of a Carbon’s Gray 10 theme style in Mapbox</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column  colLg={4} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Mapbox g90 style](images/17_adv_geo_mapbox_c_288.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of a Carbon’s Gray 90 theme style in Mapbox</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column  colLg={4} colMd={4} colSm={4} >\n\n![Mapbox g100 style](images/18_adv_geo_mapbox_d_288.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of a Carbon’s Gray 100 theme style in Mapbox</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Applying the Carbon Mapbox themes\n\nFor instructions on how to use Mapbox GL JS please read this\n[Mapbox quickstart documentation](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#quickstart).\n\nIn addition to the instructions above, when initializing a new map you can apply\nany of the 4 Carbon themes by providing the stylesheet location to the library.\n\n| Theme      | Style sheet location                                           |\n| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| _White_    | `mapbox://styles/carbondesignsystem/ck7c8cfpp08h61irrudv7f1xg` |\n| _Gray 10_  | `mapbox://styles/carbondesignsystem/ck7c8ce1y05h61ipb2fixfe76` |\n| _Gray 90_  | `mapbox://styles/carbondesignsystem/ck7c8ccac08jj1imhvd2g4qfb` |\n| _Gray 100_ | `mapbox://styles/carbondesignsystem/ck7c89g8708gy1imlz9g5o6h9` |\n\n<Title>Example</Title>\n\n```html\n<script>\n  mapboxgl.accessToken = 'YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN';\n  var map = new mapboxgl.Map({\n    // Applying the G100 theme below\n    style: 'mapbox://styles/carbondesignsystem/ck7c89g8708gy1imlz9g5o6h9',\n    // Include existing options below\n    // ...\n    // ...\n    // ...\n  });\n</script>\n```\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"75fff0a6d31e5e68bd45d82e2dee6e32","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":4959},"frontmatter":{"title":"Spatial Charts","description":"Discover spatial patterns and hierarchies, showcasing tree maps, circle packs, and geospatial charts."},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Spatial Charts\ndescription:\n  Discover spatial patterns and hierarchies, showcasing tree maps, circle packs,\n  and geospatial charts.\n---\n\nimport { getDemoGroupByTitle } from '../../../data/data-visualization';\n\nimport { AnchorLinks, AnchorLink } from 'gatsby-theme-carbon';\nimport ChartDemoGroup from '../../../components/data-visualization/ChartDemoGroup.js';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nDiscover spatial patterns and hierarchies, showcasing tree maps, circle packs,\nand geospatial charts.
